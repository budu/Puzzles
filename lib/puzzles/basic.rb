    # Returns the sum of the squares of the two biggest argument
    # given. When there's only 1 argument, returns only a square of
    # it. Returns zero if there's no argument.
    #
    # Example:
    #     biggest_sum_of_square 1, 2, 3, 4     # returns 25
    #     biggest_sum_of_square 5              # returns 25
    #     biggest_sum_of_square                # returns 0
    #
    # @param *number [Array] An array of numbers.
    # @return [Integer] See above.
